# Websites-Made-By-Me



This repository holds all of the websites/Projects I have created either during my freetime for fun or some personal projects to practice my skills at.

FTS = Final Tests 

  - This is used for when you want to upload the project to a server (ex: Filezilla) and not have to worry about .htaccess from not working.
  
NTS = Not Final Tests

  - This is for when you want to use the .htaccess file to cut out the file extension from the URL when uploading the file to a OFFICAL SERVER/HOSTING (ex: Godaddy)
  
  
JS Projects = JavaScript Projects

  - This is obvious as to what this folder is dedicated to....
  
  
This repository is subject to change when new projects are created.


Thanks,

Parker :)
